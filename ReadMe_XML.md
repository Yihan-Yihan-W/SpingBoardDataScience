1) To find the lowest infant mortality rate
   # I loop through each country by root.iter()
   # find the name, and the population of the country by find().text and 
   # use population as subchild from root, i get the population by using .text, and change it to float type
2) 10 cities with the largest population
   # I use 2011 year to compare population of each city
   # update the population dictionary {city: population} if the year of the data is 2011.
   # read dictionary as df, and sort the values
3) 10 ethnic groups with the largest overall populations
   # use a for loop through population, compare each attribute year, 
   # update the list of population if the year attribute is latest
   # get the list of population of each ethnictity in each country
   # read list as dataframe, group by ethnicity and sum within each group
